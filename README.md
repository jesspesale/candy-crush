# M&M Crush

Welcome to M&M Crush! This is a simplified version of the game "Candy Crush" built with ReactJS and M&M's as the candy. This project is a great great way to learn some new React/JS skills as well as enhance my HTML/CSS abilities. 

To play the game you have to move the m&m's to either get three or four in a row. You can only move the m&m's one candy over either up, down, right or left (no diagnanol moves allowed). If you get 3 in a row it is +3 points and 4 in a row is +4 points. If you get to 55 points in 15 or less moves, you win! Under 55 points results in a loss, but you can play as many times as you'd like.
